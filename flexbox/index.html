                <h3><i class="fa fa-history" aria-hidden="true"></i> The History Of Roland TB-303</h3>
                <p>How did the TB-303 bass synthesizer become such a well-known and highly regarded sound in dance music? Today
                    guest contributor Akhil Kalepu goes in-depth with the full history of the Roland TB-303 and how its shortcomings
                    became some of the most sought after sounds in the era of acid house that followed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Featured gear: </strong>TB-303</li>
                    <li><strong>Manufacturer: </strong>Roland</li>
                    <li><strong>Date Released: </strong>1982(production ended 1984)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In a world of software emulations digital workstation, it’s hard to be impressed by a single oscillator monosynth,
                    but few electronic musical instruments have made an impact as big as the TB-303. Several machines have
                    entered electronic music history as pivotal artifacts of the culture. Released in 1982, Roland’s “Transistor
                    Bass” unit was a sleeper hit that became an iconic piece of electronic music culture, analogous to the
                    Stratocaster for rock and the MPC for hip-hop.</p>

                <p>Created by Roland engineer Tadao Kikumoto, the box was largely written off as a failure after just 18 months
                    of production. It was released alongside the TR-606 drum machine as an accompaniment for guitarists,
                    but with unrealistic sounds and a difficult interface the box got little traction upon release. Roland
                    stopped production in 1984, having sold only 10,000 units.</p>

        <p>While many of the 303’s early appearances made use of the box’s unconventional nature, the acid house sound did
                not come together until the late 80s. Due to its commercial failure, there were lots of these bass units
                available for a low price, making them an attractive buy for bedroom electronic producers.</p>
